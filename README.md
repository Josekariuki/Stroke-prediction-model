# Stroke-prediction-model
# Project Description

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having a stroke based on demographic, lifestyle, and clinical features. It uses a supervised machine-learning classification approach. The goal is to demonstrate basic data-science skills including data preprocessing, data visualization, model training, and evaluation.
